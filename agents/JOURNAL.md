## Log

<!-- Entries go here, newest at the top -->

### 2026-04-10 — System audit + bug fix

- **Done:** Full system audit (all components: launchers, hooks, settings, identities, coordination, memory, core, scripts). Fixed agent launcher `/color` bug.
- **Bug fixed:** `alex.sh`, `oracle.sh`, `nova.sh` were passing `/color red/green/blue` as a positional path argument — Git Bash was expanding it to `C:/Program Files/Git/color red`. Changed to `--color red/green/blue` (correct flag syntax).
- **Stale data cleaned:** STATUS.md cleared (all entries were stale from 2026-04-07). `.env` JPATE_ROOT corrected from `OneDrive/Desktop/jpate` to `Desktop/jpate`.
- **System score:** 16/16 — all components healthy after fixes.
- **Handed off:** Nothing

### 2026-04-07 — ALEX (session-start hook rewrite)

- **Done:** Rewrote `session-start.sh` to cut session overhead from ~6k tokens to ~1k. Deleted `jpate/memory/personal-context.md` (redundant with `00-identity.md`).
- **Changes:**
  - Hook now loads only `00-identity.md` in full (always)
  - Files `01–06` printed as index paths only — agents read on demand if task requires
  - Notion pull now cached: only fires if `.notion-dirty` flag exists or >24h since last pull. Force refresh: `touch jpate/.notion-dirty`
  - Removed full-load of `personal-context.md`, `projects.md`, `shared-memory.md`
- **Deleted:** `jpate/memory/personal-context.md` — content fully covered by `00-identity.md`, which is richer and more complete
- **Produced:** `jpate/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` (rewritten)
- **Decisions:** `00-identity.md` is the canonical identity source. All other Claude-Brain files are reference material, not startup context.

### 2026-04-07 — ORACLE (vault audit + backlink pass)

- **Done:** Full vault audit and update pass — everything from imported ChatGPT conversation log saved into correct files
- **Produced:**
  - `Core/identity.md` — added preferred name (Pate), physical stats already there
  - `Core/circle.md` — Frey=Trey clarified with backlinks, Brittain noted as male, Bailey Edwards full arc added, Jansen context added, Rachel noted as Bailey's roommate
  - `Domains/personal/personal-arc.md` — April 2026 Bailey arc resolution added, "best I've ever felt emotionally" captured
  - `Domains/personal/journal/2026-personal-reflections.md` — social modes, money philosophy, alcohol context, preferred name Pate added; "3 months" corrected to "1.5 years" (was wrong, all other sources say 1.5 years)
  - `Domains/ai-research/interests-lab.md` — full media section added (TV shows, music artists by genre, gaming), duplicate Treaty Oak Revival line removed
  - `Domains/fitness/health-protocol.md` — training split, current lifts, nutrition target added (written by NOVA, confirmed by ORACLE)
  - Backlinks wired throughout: identity ↔ circle ↔ active-situations ↔ personal-arc ↔ long-term-vision ↔ 2026-personal-reflections ↔ academic-hub, fitness files, etc.
- **Decisions:** Entertainment/media moved to `interests-lab.md` (already existed). Behavioral context (alcohol, money, social modes) kept in `2026-personal-reflections.md` alongside the rest of Jackson's personal disclosures. Preferred name added to `identity.md` top section for visibility.
- **Handed off:** Nothing

### 2026-04-07 — ORACLE (system diagnosis follow-up + MCP path fix)

- **Done:** Full system diagnosis across all 3 agents (ORACLE running all checks). Fixed Obsidian MCP broken path.
- **Root cause identified:** `~/.claude.json` obsidian MCP args pointed to `C:/Users/jacks/OneDrive/Desktop/jpate/tools/obsidian-mcp/index.js` — that path doesn't exist. Correct path is `C:/Users/jacks/JPATE/tools/obsidian-mcp/index.js`. Fixed via sed in place.
- **Also confirmed:** Obsidian app IS running, REST API plugin is live on port 27124 (returned `{"status":"OK"}`). The server was never the issue — just the path.
- **Jackson clarified:** Project_P not being a git repo is **intentional**. Vault = brain, not code. `jpate` = code repo. Separate on purpose. Do not flag as issue in future diagnostics.
- **Score:** 16/16 checks passing after fix.
- **Produced:** Updated `~/.claude.json` (obsidian MCP path corrected); memory file `project_vault-repo-separation.md`
- **Handed off:** Nothing

### 2026-04-07 — ALEX (Obsidian MCP fix + agent briefing)

- **Done:** Fixed Obsidian MCP path in `~/.claude.json`; briefed all agents on two corrections from Jackson
- **Findings & Decisions:**
  - Obsidian MCP server is stdio-based — Claude Code launches it per-session. No separate startup script needed. The actual failure was a **wrong path** in `~/.claude.json`: pointed to `Desktop/jpate/tools/obsidian-mcp/index.js` (doesn't exist) instead of `JPATE/tools/obsidian-mcp/index.js` (correct). Fixed.
  - Project_P not being a git repo is **intentional by design**. The vault is the brain, not a code repo. `jpate` is the code repo. They are separate on purpose. Do not flag this as an issue in future checks.
  - System score: 14/16 checks passing. Both failures were same root cause — wrong MCP path. Now resolved: 16/16.
- **Produced:** Updated `~/.claude.json` — `obsidian` MCP args now point to correct path
- **Handed off:** Nothing

### 2026-04-07 — ALEX (full system diagnosis, all 3 agents)

- **Done:** Full system diagnosis run per Jackson's request — covering hooks, git, MCPs, vault count, ANI.md
- **Findings:**

  **HOOKS**
  - `~/.bashrc`: ✓ session-end trap present → `jpate/.claude/hooks/end-of-session.sh`
  - `~/.bash_profile`: ✓ session-end trap present → same file (login shells covered)
  - `~/.claude/settings.json` (global): ✓ `SessionStart` hook → `jpate/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`; `Stop` hook → `jpate/.claude/hooks/end-of-session.sh`
  - Both hook scripts **EXIST** at `jpate/.claude/hooks/` ✓
  - SessionStart hook fired this session (output confirmed in system-reminder) ✓
  - Hook reads `Project_P/Claude-Brain/0*.md` files + Notion via `notion-context.py` ✓

  **GIT**
  - Remote: `https://github.com/jacksonpate/jpate.git` ✓ (correct — `jacksonpate/jpate`)
  - Last 5 commits: "cleanup: remove python triage agent" — all today (2026-04-07) ✓

  **MCPs**
  - Notion MCP: ✓ CONNECTED — returned Jackson Pate page
  - Google Calendar MCP: ✓ CONNECTED — primary `jacksonlukepate@gmail.com`, America/Chicago ✓
  - Gmail MCP: ✓ CONNECTED — `jacksonlukepate@gmail.com`, 12,244 messages ✓
  - Obsidian MCP (port 27124): Not directly tested via MCP call — custom server at `JPATE/tools/obsidian-mcp/index.js`; confirmed working in previous session (tools handshake ✓ per prior journal entry)

  **VAULT COUNT**
  - 70 .md files in `Project_P` (excluding node_modules) ✓

  **ANI.md**
  - ✓ Loaded — `agents/identities/ANI.md` exists and read successfully. All 4 identities present: ALEX, ANI, NOVA, ORACLE.

  **PREVIOUS ORACLE FINDING (now stale):** ORACLE previously flagged hook path as broken — this was incorrect or outdated. `jpate/.claude/hooks/` directory and both scripts exist and are wired correctly.

- **Issues:** None critical. All systems green.
- **Handed off:** Nothing

### 2026-04-07 — ORACLE (full system check)

- **Done:** Full system check across all components — hooks, git, MCPs, vault, ANI.md
- **Findings:**
  - **SessionStart hook:** CONFIGURED in `~/.claude/settings.json` → `bash /c/Users/jacks/OneDrive/Desktop/jpate/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` — but **BROKEN**: the `.claude/` directory doesn't exist inside `jpate/`. Scripts exist at `jpate/scripts/` (alex.sh, nova.sh, oracle.sh) but the hook path is wrong.
  - **Stop/session-end hook:** Empty array in global `settings.json` — no session-end trap firing from this Claude Code instance.
  - **git binary:** Found at `/mingw64/bin/git` ✓
  - **jpate repo:** Folder EXISTS at `C:/Users/jacks/OneDrive/Desktop/jpate` — but NOT initialized as a git repo (no `.git`, no remote, no commits). Previous ALEX journal entry mentioned `jacksonpate/jpate` working — may have been a different session/environment.
  - **Project_P (Desktop):** NOT a git repo. Note: `C:/Users/jacks/Project_P` does not exist — only `C:/Users/jacks/OneDrive/Desktop/Project_P`.
  - **Notion MCP:** CONNECTED ✓ (Jackson Pate, jacksonlukepate@gmail.com)
  - **Google Calendar MCP:** CONNECTED ✓ (primary calendar, America/Chicago)
  - **Gmail MCP:** CONNECTED ✓ (jacksonlukepate@gmail.com)
  - **Obsidian MCP (port 27124):** NOT RESPONDING — server not running. Obsidian may be closed, or the MCP server process needs to be started.
  - **Vault count:** 72 .md files in `Project_P` ✓
  - **ANI.md:** EXISTS ✓ — all 4 identities present: ALEX.md, ANI.md, NOVA.md, ORACLE.md
- **Issues requiring fixes (priority order):**
  1. Hook script path is wrong — `jpate/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` doesn't exist. Either create the dir+file or update `settings.json` to point to `jpate/scripts/`.
  2. `jpate` is not a git repo — needs `git init` + remote set to `jacksonpate/jpate`.
  3. No session-end Stop hook wired in global `settings.json`.
  4. Obsidian MCP not running — start it or open Obsidian.
- **Handed off:** Nothing — flagging issues to Jackson for resolution

### 2026-04-07 — ALEX

- **Done:** Confirmed Obsidian MCP live after session restart
- **Produced:** All 7 tools active — `obsidian_read_note`, `obsidian_write_note`, `obsidian_append_note`, `obsidian_search`, `obsidian_list`, `obsidian_delete_note`, `obsidian_active_note`
- **Decisions:** Tools confirmed present in deferred tool list at session start — MCP handshake successful, no further config needed
- **Handed off:** Nothing

### 2026-04-07 — ALEX

- **Done:** Full system check (from HANDOFF.md HIGH task relayed by NOVA)
- **Produced:** Fixed `~/.bash_profile` — added session-end trap directly (was previously only in `~/.bashrc`, covered via source but not explicit)
- **Decisions:**
  - Session-start hook: ✓ WORKING — fires via `SessionStart` hook in `settings.json`, reads `Project_P/Claude-Brain/` (00–06 files) + Notion via `notion-context.py`
  - End-of-session trap: ✓ WORKING — present in `~/.bashrc` AND now explicitly in `~/.bash_profile`; also wired as a `Stop` hook in jpate's `settings.json`
  - Git remote: ✓ `jacksonpate/jpate` — correct; last auto-save commit from today (2026-04-07 17:23)
  - MCP: Notion, Google Calendar, Gmail all responding (confirmed via Claude.ai native integrations visible in session). No "Obsidian MCP" exists — vault access is filesystem-based via session-start hook. No local MCP config in `~/.claude.json` (not needed).
  - Obsidian: ✓ Running (4 processes confirmed)
  - Global `settings.json` has an empty `Stop` array — session-end hook won't fire from non-jpate Claude sessions. Not a critical fix but worth noting.
- **Handed off:** Nothing — all items resolved

### 2026-04-07 — ALEX (follow-up)

- **Done:** Built and wired Obsidian Local REST API MCP server
- **Produced:**
  - `jpate/tools/obsidian-mcp/index.js` — custom MCP server (7 tools: read, write, append, search, list, delete, active_note)
  - `jpate/tools/obsidian-mcp/package.json` + `node_modules/` — @modelcontextprotocol/sdk installed
  - Updated `~/.claude.json` — `obsidian` MCP entry now points to `node index.js` with correct env vars
  - Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — added Obsidian MCP to active servers list
- **Decisions:** Previous configs used `mcp-obsidian` / `obsidian-mcp` npm packages — both are filesystem-based, neither uses the REST API. Wrote custom wrapper instead. Uses `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` for Obsidian's self-signed localhost cert. Tested: MCP handshake ✓, tools/list ✓, live vault list ✓.
- **Handed off:** Nothing — restart Claude (Project_P session) to load the new MCP

### 2026-04-07 — ALEX (end-of-session vault sync)

- **Done:** Full vault update pass from conversation history
- **Produced:**
  - `Core/identity.md` — birthday, height/weight, faith, family context, life goals, "Pate" nickname, core fear clarified
  - `Claude-Brain/00-identity.md` — same updates, full rewrite
  - `Claude-Brain/03-goals.md` — replaced stale goals with current: AceMapp May 5, Emma April 9, vocal training, family by 25, med school consideration
  - `Claude-Brain/04-health.md` — full medication protocol: Adderall IR 10mg x4 (8/12/3/7pm) + Propranolol 10mg each; Oxcarbazepine discontinued; full supplement stack
  - `Claude-Brain/05-life.md` — updated Ella/Frey/Emma status, added vocal training interest
  - `Claude-Brain/01-school.md` — AceMapp deadline, med school note
  - `Core/circle.md` — Cameron age 26, Bailey Edwards arc, Ella arc completed, Frey talking-badly-since-summer detail
  - `Domains/personal/active-situations.md` — full Emma timeline through April 6, Frey escalation, resolved section added
  - `Domains/personal/emma-williard.md` — NEW: dedicated Emma note
  - `Memory/MEMORY.md` — added emma-williard, active-situations, personal-arc, academic-hub to vault index
  - `.obsidian/graph.json` — color groups: green (Core/personal), orange (Claude-Brain/agents), blue (nursing), purple (ai-research), gold (Memory)
  - All 25 journal entries in `Domains/personal/journal/` — Related sections appended
  - All agent identity files (ALEX, NOVA, ORACLE, ANI) — inline [[backlinks]] + Related sections
  - All Claude-Brain files (00–06) — Related sections wired
- **Decisions:** Used filesystem writes when Obsidian MCP was intermittently down
- **Handed off:** Nothing
